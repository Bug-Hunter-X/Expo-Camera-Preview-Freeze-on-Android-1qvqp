This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain Android devices. The preview freezes and the camera becomes unresponsive. This is often caused by an incompatibility between the Expo Camera API and the device's camera hardware or software.  The error is not always consistently reproducible, making it difficult to debug.  There may be no specific error messages logged in the console.
